        <h2>Chrome DevTools</h2>
        <h4>What?, Why?, How?</h4>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          A set of tools allowing developers and programmers deep access into the 
          internal of the browser and authoring and debugging web applications. 
          The Developer Tools are part of the open source Webkit project.  (what's webkit project)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          It will make you a productive developer. As a web developer or programmar you will gain a lot of facilities from
          knowing/using DevTools, you will be able to find the bugs quickly and know how to keep your Apps efficient and running
          as fast as possible.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          Just install Google Chrome browser. Congrats, No more downloads/effort.
          <br><br> You've three ways to open it:-
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>shift+ctrl+i</li>
          <li>Right-click &gt; Inspect Element</li>
          <li>View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools</li>
          <li>etc ..</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It has the newest of Chrome features. It changes and gets new features almost every day.
          Designed for developers and early adopters and can be prone to breakage!.

        <h2>Dive into the hight-level structure of the browers</h2>
        <h3>what happens when you type "google.com" in the address bar untill you see the google page</h3>
        <p>After a request got fired and a response got recieved ...</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Browser hight-level structure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> The user interface:</strong>  includes every part of the browser except the main window where you see the requested page.</li>
          <li><strong>The browser engine:</strong> the interface for querying and manipulating the rendering engine.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>The rendering engine:</strong> requesting for displaying/parsing the requested content, Ex:- if the requested content is HTML,
            it is responsible for parsing HTML and CSS and displaying the parsed content in the screen
          </li>
          <li><strong>Networking:</strong> responsible for networks calls, like HTTP requests</li>
          <li><strong>UI backend:</strong> used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. Underneath it uses the operating system user interface methods.</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript interpreter:</strong> Used to parse and execute the JavaScript code.</li>
          <li><strong>Data storage:</strong> This is a persistence layer. The browser needs to save all sorts of data on the hard disk, for examples, cookies.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section><img src="./images/layers.png">
        <p class="al mtl"><strong> Note: </strong> Unlike most browsers,Chrome holds multiple instances of the rendering engine - one for each tab. Each tab is a separate process.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Rendering Engine</h2>
        <p>When a response delivered to the browser through the network layer, it starts its tour through the render engine.  </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Parse HTML to construct DOM nodes <strong>(content tree)</strong> (What's DOM?)</li>
          <li>Parse external CSS and in style elements + html to traverse to <strong> Render tree </strong></li>
          <li>Render tree contains elements as rectangles in right order to be displayed.</li>
          <li>Goes through layout processing, giving the element the real coordinates where it should appear on the screen.</li>
          <li>Then it will go through painting whereas each node will be painted using the UI backend layer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Use Tools</h2>
        <p>Overall, there are eight main groups of tools available via Developer Tools.</p>
        <p>Elements, Networks, Sources, Timeline, Profiles, Resources, Audits and Console.</p>
        <h6><strong>Note:</strong> may be you see different tools as tools get changed during versions, but not significant change.</h6>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Elements tool:</h3>
        <p>
          Allows you to see the web page as the browser sees it.
          That is, using the Elements tool, 
          you can see the raw HTML, raw CSS styles, 
          the Document Object Model, and manipulate either in real time.
        </p><br><br><img src="images/elementtool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Networks tool:</h3>
        <p>
          Use the Resources tool to learn what components your web page
          or application is requesting from web servers, how long these requests take,
          and how much bandwidth is required. You can also view the HTTP request and response headers for each of your resources. 
          The Resources tool is perfect for helping you speed up page load times.
        </p><br><br><img src="images/networktool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Sources tool:</h3>
        <p>
          To peer inside the JavaScript for a page, 
          you will use the Scripts tool. Here you can find a list of scripts
          required by the page plus a full featured script debugger.
          You can even change the JavaScript on the fly!
        </p><br><br><img src="images/resourcestool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Profiles tool:</h3>
        <p>
          The Profiles tool helps you capture and analyze the performance of 
          JavaScript scripts. For example, you can learn which functions
          take the most time to execute and zero in on exactly where to optimize.
        </p><br><br><img src="images/profilestool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Resources tool:</h3>
        <p>
          Modern web applications require more persistence than simply cookies,
          and the Resources tool helps you track, query, and debug local browser storage.
          This tool can display and query data stored in local databases,
          local storage, session storage, and cookies.
        </p><br><br><img src="images/resourcestool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Audit tool:</h3>
        <p>
          The Audit tool is like having your own web optimization consultant sitting
          next to you. This tool can analyze a page as it loads and provide suggestions
          and optimizations for decreasing page load time and
          increase perceived (and real) responsiveness. 
        </p><br><br><img src="images/audittool.png" width="600px">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Console tool:</h3>
        <p>
          Last but definitely not least, the Developer Tools offers a full featured Console.
          From the Console, you can <strong>interact with your app's views and scripts </strong>, <strong>run javascript commands</strong> 
          and <strong>view log output</strong>.

        <h2>Editing local files through workspaces</h2>
        <p>
          Workspaces are a powerful Chrome DevTools feature,
          which turns it into a real IDE. Workspaces match
          the files in the Sources tab to your local project files,
          so now you can edit and save directly, without having to
          copy/paste your changes into an external text editor.

        <h2>Timeline and profiles </h2>
        <p>
          Being aware of how to measure and improve performance
          can be a useful skill and in this short post,
          I'll give you a quick refresher on how this can be
          done with the Chrome DevTools Timeline and Profiles.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          The Timeline panel provides an overview of where time
          is spent loading up your web application such as how
          long it takes to <strong>process DOM events </strong>, <strong>render page layouts </strong>
          or <strong>paint elements to the screen </strong>. it allows you to track
          frames per second and each frame what work was involved.
